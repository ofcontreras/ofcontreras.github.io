# About Me

I have a PhD in Economics from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a BA (Hons) from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching ([CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/)) in Mexico City.

Currently, I am an Associate Director and Research Economist at the [Milken Institute](http://milkeninstitute.org/). My work combines standard econometrics techniques with machine learning tools and economic theory to gain insights into various issues, helping decision-makers implement better data-driven decisions.

Before joining the Institute, I was a senior economist in the research department of the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), where I developed and estimated various models for forecasting and scenario analysis of key macroeconomic indicators.

Prior to my work at the Bank, I was an Assistant Professor at the University College for Financial Studies ([CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/)) in Madrid, Spain, where I studied housing market regulations, financial market frictions, and the link between political instability and foreign investment.
