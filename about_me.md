# About Me

I have a PhD in Economics from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a BA (Hons) from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching ([CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/)) in Mexico City.

Currently, I am an Associate Director and Research Economist at the [Milken Institute](http://milkeninstitute.org/). I have worked on a variety of topics such as financial literacy, the determinants of foreign investment, and how rating agencies evalute a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. 

Before joining the Institute, I was a senior economist in the research department of the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), where I was responsible for providing macroeconomic analysis on monetary policy issues and conducting original research on macroeconomic and financial topics.

Prior to the Bank, I was an Assistant Professor at the University College for Financial Studies ([CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/)) in Madrid, Spain, where I studied housing market regulations, financial market frictions, and investment cycles.
