# About Me

I have a PhD in Economics from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a BA (Hons) from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching ([CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/)) in Mexico City.

Currently, I am an Applied Research Scientist (Economics) at [Ethos Life Insurance](https://www.ethoslife.com/), where I've been working on price experimentation and marketing budget allocation. Before joining Ethos, I was Director of International Finance at the [Milken Institute](http://milkeninstitute.org/), where I worked on a variety of topics ranging from the state of financial literacy in the U.S. and the determinants of foreign investment to the way in which rating agencies evalute a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

Prior to the Milken Institute, I was a senior economist in the research department of the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html), where I was responsible for providing macroeconomic analysis on monetary policy issues and conducting original research on macroeconomic and financial topics.

In another life, I was an Assistant Professor at the University College for Financial Studies ([CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/)) in Madrid, Spain, where I studied housing market regulations, financial market frictions, and investment cycles.
