## Welcome to My Webpage!

My name is Oscar Contreras.

I am a research economist and data-scientists with over ten years of experience in academia, government, and non-government organizations.

My work combines standard econometrics techniques with machine learning tools and economic theory to gain insights into various issues, helping decision-makers implement better data-driven decisions.

Here you'll find information on some of my [research projects](./projects.html), as well as my previous [work experience](./about_me.html).
