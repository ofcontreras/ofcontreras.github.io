## Welcome to My Webpage!

My name is Oscar Contreras and I am an Associate Director and Research Economist at the [Milken Institute](http://milkeninstitute.org/). 

Before joining the Institute, I was a senior economist at the research department of the Central Bank of Mexico, where I was responsible for providing macroeconomic analysis on monetary policy issues and conducting original research on macroeconomic and financial topics. Prior to my work at the Bank, I was an Assistant Professor at the University College for Financial Studies ([CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/)) in Madrid, Spain. 

I have a PhD in Economics from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a BA (Hons) in Economics from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching ([CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/)) in Mexico City.
