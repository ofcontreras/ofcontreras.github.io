## Welcome to My Webpage!

My name is Oscar Contreras and I am an Associate Director and Research Economist at the Milken Institute. 

Before joining the Institute, I was a senior economist at the research department of the Central Bank of Mexico, where I was responsible for providing macroeconomic analysis on monetary policy issues and conducting original research on macroeconomic and financial topics. Prior to my work at the Bank, I was an Assistant Professor at the University College for Financial Studies (CUNEF) in Madrid, Spain. 

I have a PhD in Economics from Northwestern University and a BA (Hons) in Economics from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching (CIDE) in Mexico City.
