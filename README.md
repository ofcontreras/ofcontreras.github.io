## Welcome to My Webpage!

My name is Oscar Contreras.

I am a research economist and data-scientist with over ten years of experience in academia, government, non-proft and profit sectors.

My work combines standard econometrics techniques with machine learning tools and economic theory to gain valuable insights into various economic and social issues.

Here you'll find information on some of my [research projects](./projects.html), as well as my previous [work experience](./about_me.html).
